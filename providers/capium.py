# Layout notes from pdfplumber inspection:
#   - Line 2: "Employer Name  Title FirstName Surname  DD/MM/YYYY" — all on one line, no delimiter
#   - Line 4: "NI_NUMBER  TAX_CODE  BACS  M 10" — period label follows BACS
#   - \xad (soft hyphen, U+00AD) appears as column padding on the HOURS summary row
#   - Several YTD values are unlabelled standalone £ lines; we only extract ones we can verify
#   - ni_employer, pension_employer, ytd_taxable, ytd_pension_employer are absent from this format
